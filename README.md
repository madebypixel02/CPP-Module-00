## Introduction

This is the first project we've ever done in C++. For this reason, things *will* start slow. In this first set of exercises we will learn about the basic syntax of C++, namespaces, classes, member functions, and several other new concepts. All in all, it's lots of basic stuff.

## ex00

This first exercise is quite simple, we are asked to create a program that takes arguments and prints them back to the terminal in capital letters. If no arguments are provided the program will print out a default message, also in captial letters.

### Example

## ex01

This second exercise is a bit more fun. We have to simulate a phonebook with a terminal interactive UI. We can **ADD** or **SEARCH** for contacts, and we can also **EXIT**, clearing the list of contacts and ending the program. The phonebook can receive up to 8 contacts, such that the 9th contact will replace the 1st contact, the 10th will replace the 2nd, and so on.

## Installation

For this project and fututre C++ projects it is only required to have `clang` and/or `gcc`, which provide their respective compilers `clang++` and `g++`. It is also recommended to install the `valgrind` package on **Linux** for debugging purposes. Every exercise (unless specified otherwise) includes its own Makefile with the necessary instructions. In some cases certain tweaks needed to be made to ensure the most similar results in both **Linux** and **MacOS**.

## Summary

As a first module, it was mostly easy, except for *ex02*, which was a bit tricky to understand at first.
